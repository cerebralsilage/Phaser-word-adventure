# Phaser-word-adventure
 
This was a codeacademy project.  I built the functionality, but codeacademy supplied the images and page objects(storyline).  I also added a background color, centered the game canvas, and made a canvas border just for looks.  

## Features
* Built using Phaser 3
* JavaScript

## How To Play
Just click on the response boxes and follow the story.  There are muliple endings and a few characters if you figure out the path.

## Lisense
MIT
